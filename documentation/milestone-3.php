			<h3>Mobile Wireframe</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="../img/mobilehome.png">
				<figcaption>
					'Home' div with a header, sticky-footer, and top-right nav drop down menu containing
					social profile links as well as a link to download a .pdf of my resume. The centerpiece
					will be a zia symbol terminating in links to my internal site navs.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="../img/mobileabout.jpg">
				<figcaption>
					'About Me' div with a header, footer, and top-right nav drop down menu containing
					internal site navs. This will feature a professional head shot floated amongst introductory
					text, and perhaps a speech bubble greeting. Below, a bootstrap col-4 spread consisting
					of descriptive thumbnails and captions outlining some of my personal interests, such
					as various web technologies, horticulture, and zymurgy.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="../img/mobileeducation.png">
				<figcaption>
					'Education' div featuring an animated JQuery time line of my educational milestones. Each node
					will present a modal window with a brief description of my achievements at each school.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="../img/mobileworks.png">
				<figcaption>
					'Works' div will contain an image gallery, each thumbnail of which will be a link to a
					third-party site. These might be presented by an animated carousel of
					screenshots from various projects I've been a part of.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img src="../img/mobilecontact.png">
				<figcaption>
					'Contact' div will contain bootstrap icons for social profile links, as well as
					a simple form requesting sender's name, preferred e-mail, and a text box to be
					emailed to my Appists account.
				</figcaption>

			<h3>Desktop Wireframe</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="../img/desktophome.png">
				<figcaption>
					'Home' desktop version div with a header, sticky-footer, and social profile links. The centerpiece
					will be a zia symbol terminating in links to my internal site navs. On the side, if consistent
					with responsive design, I'd like to have a scaled-down image of my resume, which can be viewed
					as a modal window when clicked. The option to download the .pdf should still be part of the
					top drop down menu.
